Welcome to my Ktor Playground Repository! üöÄ

**Repository Description:**

As a solo learner taking my first steps with Ktor, this repository is my hub for documenting progress. Here, I'm focusing on building a solid understanding of how to implement different aspects of using Ktor server with authorizationd, DI, etc.

**Key Features:**

üîê **Authorization Demos (Work in Progress):** My journey involves building demos that illustrate various ways to implement authorization. These demos mirror my learning curve, starting with basic token-based authentication and evolving into more advanced techniques.

üåê **Upcoming API Playground:** A space is planned where I can experiment with different authorization scenarios using a custom API. This hands-on approach will help solidify my comprehension of the concepts I'm learning.

üõ†Ô∏è **Dependency Injection (DI) Exploration:** As I progress, I'll also delve into using `kotlin-inject` for DI within Ktor. I'll share my experiences with integrating DI into my projects and how it complements the authorization process.

**Who is this repository for?**

- Myself, as I navigate the world of Ktor, authorization, and DI, tracking my learning progress in one place.
- Fellow learners curious about Ktor, authorization, DI, API and how they can be integrated effectively.
- Those who want to observe the learning process and challenges of a newcomer in the Ktor ecosystem.
