Welcome to my Ktor Playground Repository! 🚀

**Repository Description:**

As a solo learner taking my first steps with Ktor, this repository is my hub for documenting progress. Here, I'm focusing on building a solid understanding of how to implement different aspects of using Ktor server with authorizationd, DI, etc.

**Key Features:**

🔐 **Authorization Demos (Work in Progress):** My journey involves building demos that illustrate various ways to implement authorization. These demos mirror my learning curve, starting with basic token-based authentication and evolving into more advanced techniques.

🌐 **Upcoming API Playground:** A space is planned where I can experiment with different authorization scenarios using a custom API. This hands-on approach will help solidify my comprehension of the concepts I'm learning.

🛠️ **Dependency Injection (DI) Exploration:** As I progress, I'll also delve into using `kotlin-inject` for DI within Ktor. I'll share my experiences with integrating DI into my projects and how it complements the authorization process.

📊 **MongoDB Integration:** Some part of this journey involves integrating MongoDB into Ktor applications. I'm sharing my insights on setting up, connecting to, and utilizing MongoDB to store and manage data.

**Who is this repository for?**

- Myself, as I navigate the world of Ktor, authorization, and DI, tracking my learning progress in one place.
- Fellow learners curious about Ktor, authorization, DI, API and how they can be integrated effectively.
- Those who want to observe the learning process and challenges of a newcomer in the Ktor ecosystem.

**Credits:**

A big shoutout to the YouTube channel of [Philipp Lackner](https://www.youtube.com/@PhilippLackner) for providing an insightful tutorial that has been instrumental in my learning journey. The tutorial's comprehensive explanation of Ktor concepts and its practical examples have been invaluable in building the foundation of this repository.

I highly recommend checking out his tutorial [here](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=uezSuUQt6DY) if you're interested in diving deeper into Ktor and its various features.
